# store_inv_app
This is a proyect for a friend who needs an app to have control of the inventory of his bussiness, it doesn't requires too mocuh things to do, just like a CRUD app but, of course, it needs to storage the information of products. So for this i will use the local storage of the browser beacuse a data base it's too much, at least for this project.
